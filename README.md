# Eastern Sun Resurrected
Eastern Sun Resurrected is an individual effort to extend the port that tireheb and bonesy made for the classic eastern sun mod (this is a fork from bonesy's repository). This enhancement will be long term and will include almost everything: skill reworks, class rebalance, increased difficulty, new content, new recipes etc.

This eastern sun version will be a long, ongoing project and I'll probably be the only one working on it. I have limited modding knowledge as this is the first time I'm modding diablo 2. The good part is that I have more than 10k hours invested in arpgs of any kind and I'll try to make this the best version of a diablo 2 mod possible.

# Installation Guide
You need to download D2Launch for the best experience, which can be found here: https://www.d2rmodding.com/modtools

After the previous step, you need to create a **Mods** folder within the Diablo II Resurrected folder. In the Mods folder, extract the archive that you downloaded from this repository (Code -> Download Zip).

**Very important** - You need to rename the extracted folder to Eastern Sun (from Eastern Sun-main, probably) so it matches the Eastern Sun.mpq child folder. This is a limitation and there's nothing I can do about it.

# Disclaimer
Since this is an ongoing beta and since I have limited experience with modding diablo 2, I strongly suggest you use the periodic Auto-Backup Characters option from D2Launch (Options -> QoL Options), such that if I release a broken version, you can always recover corrupted save files.

Since the first stage of the road map is buffing characters, the mod will feel rather easy for a while and will probably be balanced to be played on /players 8 until I increase the overall difficulty.

# Road Map
1. Character balance - All classes and builds will receive buffs (or nerfs, but rarely) to reach a certain balance status. A lot of old diablo 2 skills will be replaced with better ones (see Guided Arrow rework into Tornado Shot) or buffed in other ways. The main goal here is to make skills feel good and have at least some use in certain cases. No skill will be overpowered just because and the goal is to not have any skill which doesn't have any place in the game (similar to a lot of skills from vanilla diablo 2).
2. Difficulty overhaul - Once I'm done with adjusting the classes, I will raise the overall difficulty of the game by either simply increasing basic stats of monsters (damage, health, speed) or by giving them new skils and AI personalities.
3. New content - In the relatively distant future, I'll try to add new content in the form of red portals (similar to how vanilla ubers work) and the zones will be level templates from vanilla diablo 2 (no new custom zones). The reason for this is because modding new zones manually in d2r is almost impossible due to the lack of tools to leverage the exposed data (I'm not entirely sure how it all works, but as far as I know, all objects, walls, obstacles etc. within a level are exported as a json file with various properties and you have to modify each object individually, so until a new tool that manipulates those jsons is created, making custom levels like the ones found in median xl for example will be a tremendous effort not worth of anyone's time).

   Item changes, additions, new cube recipes - I have plans for new and cool items (and perhaps super rare unique items that you can't normally obtain through Ancient's gift stone, but only from drops), but I'm not sure when I'll get on with this. New unique charms are also planned and will probably drop from new ubers. I will add new cube recipes as I see fit, but no cube recipes are planned as of now.

   Bug fixes - This will be an ongoing process. I will fix bugs as I find them. It's possible some bugs will never be fixed (mostly due to my lack of modding knowledge or perhaps engine limitations).
