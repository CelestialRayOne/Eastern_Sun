Three folders have been created for now:
- ColumnsOnly: These files have had columns added/removed/changed as needed for D2R...however values have not been updated or verified.
- Unaltered: These files required no modifications for D2R compatibility
- Unused: These files are either hardcoded or make use of code-editing/dll injection to function
