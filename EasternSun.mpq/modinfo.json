Please visit the ES Github for source files, PR Requests and more. Enjoy!"
News 2 Title: "D2RLaunch 2.0 has arrived!"
News 2 Message: "D2RLaunch has been re-built from the ground up to be more stable, more efficient and have improved functionality. It will look and behave very similarly to the old D2RLaunch; just now with a more dynamic UI and "professional" implementation. Please give special Thanks to @Alias and all his effort in spearheading this re-vamp. More details of the new and improved D2RLaunch can be found on our discord."
