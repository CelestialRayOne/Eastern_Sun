Before installing Eastern Sun Resurrected new version:
- Delete ALL previous ES Resurrected version: don't replace content, simply ERASE IT (escept the saved game folder)
- Once installed extract ALL the scrolls from your Tome Container and convert them to Dstone (Ancient Scroll + key):
  Ancient Scrolls now aren't required anymore for recipes, so are obsolete and useless and their only utility by now
  are to be converted into Dragonstones: in next update even their itemstatscosts and properties will be removed to make
  room for more properties
- READ the player's manual (it's inside the Eastern Sun folder)
