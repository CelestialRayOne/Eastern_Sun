Eastern Sun is not my creation, please do not credit me for it.
Furthermore, Tireheb has done most of the conversion work; please give him the credit he deserves.
I am simply helping finish/package the (currently abandoned) project for player's enjoyment.
Ongoing development from myself is not planned beyond the initial release; but I may still help with bug fixes or feature implementations as i'm able.

Please use the included Player's Manual and read the other documentation for best results. Enjoy!
